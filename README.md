Assignment for K-means assignment for Coursera course: Foundations of Data Science: K-Means Clustering in Python by University of London &amp; Goldsmiths, University of London

Dataset is a simplified version of this one: https://www.openml.org/d/1462


Future me,

Final banknotes notebook has code on how to colour a scatter graph's points according to a third varaible (red and green graph). 
And also code on how to colour two or more clusters differently (it's only 1 line of code! I spent hours looking for how to do this and only found errors! All thanks to two fellow learners on course forum). It's the last three graphs, too tired to make 1. 

Bye Future Me :)
